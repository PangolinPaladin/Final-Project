            Not sure if this will be valuable time, really struggling with being able to focus after a long day building in the heat. one of my main issues is trying the remember these funcitons, I know we downloaded and initialized things, but I cannot remember exactly how those went, and know they were frought with strife. Thinking back months is killing me.

        Today: 
            Setup some of my structure, including bringing over skeletons for index, css, html, and folders.
            Patched over the crunchy stuff, json packages, pipfiles, vite.config, db.py, eslint, gitignores. 
        Holdup: 
            Getting everything running. Importing pipfiles from shrinkray today, we shall see if that helps.
            Pipenv seemed to run the shell, and download fastapi and uvicorn successfully, and they showed up in Pipfile, but Terminal cannot seem to find either the file, or the command python. 
        Notes: 
            Do I need to create the .env and .gitignore files? Supabase I assume is needed, it would generate a new secret key correct? 
            Ignore github concerns. Found.

        Not a lot, didn't have much time but did some reading and fussed around, mostly unsuccessfully.

    Today: 
        Really hoping I can get a meeting tomorrow to help walking through the setup of things. So today, Im just going to be just focusing on trying to get some roots or pages worked out, so that when Im online I can start moving through CSS and making sure the HTML is what I want
        Got all my components put in, and tweaked to be what I think I want. Still need to do some CSS, and see if the colors fit. 
    Holdup: 
        Questions: In the jsx, we have the Aunthintication "call" in the middle of the list, but don't have to call a new list for that. I guess not a question but weird.

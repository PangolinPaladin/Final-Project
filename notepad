            Not sure if this will be valuable time, really struggling with being able to focus after a long day building in the heat. one of my main issues is trying the remember these funcitons, I know we downloaded and initialized things, but I cannot remember exactly how those went, and know they were frought with strife. Thinking back months is killing me. 
        Yesterday: Nothing 
        Today: 
            Setup some of my structure, including bringing over skeletons for index, css, html, and folders.
            Patched over the crunchy stuff, json packages, pipfiles, vite.config, db.py, eslint, gitignores. 
        Holdup: 
            Getting everything running. Importing pipfiles from shrinkray today, we shall see if that helps.
            Pipenv seemed to run the shell, and download fastapi and uvicorn successfully, and they showed up in Pipfile, but Terminal cannot seem to find either the file, or the command python. 
        Notes: 
            Do I need to create the .env and .gitignore files? Supabase I assume is needed, it would generate a new secret key correct? 
            Ignore github concerns. Found.

    Today: 
        Not a lot, didn't have much time but did some reading and fussed around, mostly unsuccessfully.
    Holdup: 
        The setup is KILLING ME.

    Today: 
        Really hoping I can get a meeting tomorrow to help walking through the setup of things. So today, Im just going to be just focusing on trying to get some roots or pages worked out, so that when Im online I can start moving through CSS and making sure the HTML is what I want
        Got all my components put in, and tweaked to be what I think I want. Still need to do some CSS, and see if the colors fit. 
    Holdup: 
        Questions: In the jsx, we have the Aunthintication "call" in the middle of the list, but don't have to call a new list for that. I guess not a question but weird.

        Got all my components coded, maybe some slight CSS changes, but minimal. I will need to call the Links/Routes once those are built 
    Today: 
        Starting with pages today. Still need to do my Crop pages: probably crop_addition, crop_maintenance, and current_crops? I want the path to be 
        Home/Landing Page
        --> current_crops
            -->crop maintenance 
                I need to find out how to just have this call which crop is being maintained... 
            --> crop_addition 
                this would add a new plant into the mainframe. 
        First checkin, hoping to take and work through some Routes while my wife drives to the doctor but we'll see if I get too carsick. 
        Hangups/Questions: 
            why do some of the pages in shrinkray have semi-colons to end and others dont? 
            Need to find a good tutorial of setting up node npm or whatever it was, along with python and pip shell. 
    
notes from 08.12.25
    Tokens in API is a good place to start looking at how time works in apps and understanding tracking. The session and tokens created have a timeout, watering schedule or harvesting schedule could possibly run on the same system?
